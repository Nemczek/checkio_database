# CheckIO database project

In this project I downloaded data about progress made by my university class on https://checkio.org and exported it to SQLite database. 

To create database you need to run it with python from command line. To get data from checkio platform you need a special token, which is provided in checkio_token file. For now database file will be created in the same folder with source code files but this will be changed soon. In the near future I plan to add a couple of new functionalities E.g.

1) Schedueling using Apache Airflow
2) Raporting in some way (propably simple html file)
3) I'm going to use some PySpark functionalities (I think that data is not big enough to use PySpark since calculations does not takes too long to complete, but i want some practice.)
4) Some unit tests

That's it for now. Enjoy! :smile:
