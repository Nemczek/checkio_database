# CheckIO managment system

With this project I want to present you tool for managing your class on [PyCheckio](https://py.checkio.org) platform. Tool will help you track the number of tasks done by students, number of comments and votes recived from other's and even show you number of tasks done each day. Besides that you can download all available data in *.csv format. Website was made with [Streamlit](https://discuss.streamlit.io). (Here paste link for website)

That's it for now. Enjoy! :smile:
